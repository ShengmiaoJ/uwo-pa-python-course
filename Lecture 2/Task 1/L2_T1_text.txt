Titius-Bode law
---------------

Make a list of planet distances from the Sun (semimajor axis) using the Bode’s law and calculate the difference in % from the real planet’s distance.

Here is how you can calculate the deviation percentage:

Deviation percentage = (observed - expected)/expected * 100

Steps for solving the problem:

    - Find the formula for calculating planet distances using Bode’s law: a = 0.4 + 0.3*2^m

    - Make a list of “m’s”: -inf, 0, 1, 2… 7 (question: how can we roughly approximate minus infinity?)

    - Make a list of known planet distances

    - Go through each “m” for each planet and calculate its predicted distance and the difference in % from the known distance: diff = (known_distance - predicted)/predicted*100%
